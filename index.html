            This is a personal page dedicated only to One Piece, as a fan of
            this work, I want to collect all the information and make it more
            attractive to new people who want to discover this story, as it can
            be overwhelming due to the years that the manga has been in
            development, the anime is still on air, and recently began the live
            action on netflix, there are many ways to discover this world, and
            all are correct, different, and independently enjoyable. Welcome
            nakama* to the longest pirate adventure in history!
